  Features
  <br>
</h1>

> [!NOTE]  
> **This program is not designed for everyone It might seem a bit confusing I will update the program to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing next time**

* Delete Existing Files: The delete_files function deletes any files specified in the list if they exist, otherwise it informs that they do not exist.
* Create New Files: The create_file function creates a new file if it doesnâ€™t already exist. It prompts the user to enter data line by line until they type 'done', at which point it saves the data to the file.
* Get File Data: The get_file_data function reads the contents of a file and returns it as a list of lines.
* Check Missing Data: The check_files function compares the contents of two files (a "ram" file and a "sheets" file). It identifies lines missing in each file and writes this information to an output file if there are any discrepancies.
* Main Function: The main function orchestrates the process by:
  - Deleting any existing versions of the "Main.txt", "Check.txt", and "MissingData.txt" files.
  - Creating fresh "Main.txt" and "Check.txt" files with user input.
  - Checking for missing data between the two files and reporting any discrepancies to "MissingData.txt".
  - Prompting the user to press Enter to continue at the end.

  How To Use

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vouvy/Check-Name-Duplicate/main/Img/Check-Name-Duplicate.gif)

> [!TIP]
> **If a message appears stating 'Missing data found. Please check MissingData.txt,' it indicates that there is a data inconsistency You can verify the specific discrepancies by examining the MissingData.txt file**

> [!TIP]
> **However, if a message 'No missing data', it indicates that all data is identical**
